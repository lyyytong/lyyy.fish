                <p>
                    Miller, Charles, 2022, "Historical Conflict Event Dataset", <a
                        href="https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6ZFC0V" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/6ZFC0V</a>, Harvard Dataverse, V3
                </p>
                <h1>Probabilities</h1>
                <p>
                    The dataset contains 8,881 battles between the years 1468 BC and 2003. Percentages were calculated
                    in this order:
                <ul>
                    <li>A war in any given century may have been waged accross more than one territory. Each has their
                        own probability based on how many battles occured in that war and location.</li>
                    <li>Battle features â€” whether on land or at sea, its size and participants â€” depend on the records
                        of that specific war in that specific location.</li>
                    <li>The likelihood of fighting for any participant depends on how often that side engaged in battle.
                    </li>
                    <li>The likelihood of winning, losing, and/or a massacre depends on the track record of
                        that side in
                        that war and location.</li>
                    <li>Survival rates were made up for a bit of personal stake: by default
                        it's 50%, becomes 75% if your side won the battle, down to 30% if lost, and
                        under
                        10% if your side lost and was massacred. The displayed rate was randomized (give or take a few
                        %) for variety.</li>

                </ul>
                </p>
                <h1>Data Cleaning</h1>
                <p>
                    I manually filled a few missing values for battle locations based on the historical description
                    provided
                    for each data point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Names of the larger wars to which the battles belong were edited for
                    consistency, for example "World War One" and "World War 1" became "World War I". Some were
                    changed for ease
                    of calculating
                    probabilities, such as several Napoleonic campaigns, each with varied names, were grouped into a
                    long Napoleonic war.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some names of battle participants were edited for clarity, especially when it's a civil war:
                    fighting in
                    the "Argentinian civil war" on the side of "Argentina" means fighting for the ruling government
                    against
                    opposing parties, and were reflected as such.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A big change was battle scale, or size, called the Lehmann Zhukov scale in the dataset: more than
                    43% of
                    the data had no information on scale. I made a big assumption that larger battles would likely
                    get more detailed reports, and so ascribed the smallest scale (up to 50,000 soldiers on either side)
                    to
                    all these data points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These changes and other typo edits were based on very quick search, with results from Wikipedia and
                    other online sources. There are surely many errors from my lack of understanding and familiarity
                    with
                    historical contexts.
                </p>
                <h1>Other Notes</h1>
                <p>
                    On what the dataset's author called the battle's "theatre" â€” whether it took place on land, at sea,
                    or
                    in the air: all land battles of the 20th century were assumed to have tactical air support since,
                    according to the author, they're largely ubiquitous in post-1918 warfare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A battle has three possible outcomes: won, lost, or inconclusive result. The
                    third is rare and means something like a tie, where according to the author both sides achieved
                    their
                    tactical goals.
                </p>
