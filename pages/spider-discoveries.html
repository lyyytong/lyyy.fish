                *Grouping species by their genus is one of several ways. Here are the different levels of spider
                grouping, sorted from more specific to more general:
                <ul>
                    <li>Several spider species can belong to a genus; e.g. the black widow spider and its less venomous
                        brown
                        relative belong to the genus Latrodectus.</li>
                    <li>Several genera belong to a family; e.g. Latrodectus and Parasteatoda (genus of the common house
                        spiders)
                        both belong to the family Theridiidae.</li>
                    <li>Several families belong to an infraorder; e.g. Theridiidae and Desidae (family to which belong
                        marine
                        spiders that live inbetween ocean tides) belong to the infraorder Araneomorphae.</li>
                    <li>Several infraorders belong to a suborder; and all suborders, in turn, belong to the umbrella
                        order
                        Araneae â€” air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs, fangs generally able to inject venom,
                        and
                        spinnerets that extrude silk â€” known as spiders.</li>
                </ul>
                (The order Araneae itself belongs to the class Arachnid, which includes spiders, scorpions, ticks,
                mites, vinegaroons, and others.)
            </div>
            <p>**Since this was mainly a visualization exercise, I took a lot of liberties in manually attributing
                continent to discovery locations. For example, St. Helena island was grouped into Africa, even though
                it's almost half way between South America and
                Africa. Species with Mediterranean tags were grouped into Europe, even though
                they very well could be found in North African port cities. Some remote locations like the South
                Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, although closer to South America, were put together with the French
                Southern and Antarctic Lands into the continent of Antartica (which in the end was not shown in the
                graphs as it has too few species). Manually editing more than 47 thousand data points plus a
                weak knowledge in geography led to some comatose decisions I'd really like to avoid in the next
                project.</p>
