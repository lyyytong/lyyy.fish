Donnie,Male,2017,Cairns Terrier,S,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,"In February 2021, little Donnie was found dragging himself on the street with both back legs nonfunctional. At the vet, the diagnosis revealed he had severe nerve damage in one leg needing amputation, while his other leg atrophied from inactivity. After months of rehabilitation and a special wheelchair, he is now happy on three legs. He is incontinent, requiring diapers, and needs a family that is understanding of this. Slow leisurely walks with his wheelchair, maximum 15 minutes twice a day, keep him in good shape. Due to his limited movement, he can be startled by other dogs and prefers to be a solo guy for all your attention. He's super friendly with humans, loves snuggles and is great with children of all ages."
Snowy,Male,2016,Mixed,S,2,2,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Snowy was rescued from a pagoda, where he received little help for severe mange and blood parasites that left him clinging to life. In the care of Laws for Paws Vietnam, he defied all odds to make a full recovery, now missing just a few teeth from old age. Being an older guy, he doesn't like to be disturbed during afternoon naps and would love a home that is calm and patient. Entering his third year of waiting for a forever family, he proves that age is just a number, radiating youthful spirit with an array of funny faces. He's a mix of different local breeds, including Phu Quoc, with a small body weighing no more than 10kg, making him perfect for apartment life. If his future family has small children, they need to be gentle and respect his personal space."
Coco,Female,2022,Local,S,2,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Coco's previous owner decided not to return to Vietnam after a family visit, leaving her in the care of a flatmate facing housing challenges. Her temporary stay in a boarding facility couldn't continue as Tet holiday was around the corner, and she soon joined the pack at Laws for Paws Vietnam. Initially a bit shy and cautious, she forms close bonds with a select few, becoming a loyal companion and displaying fierce loyalty once trust is established. She enjoys doing command training with student volunteers, showcasing her intelligence and adaptability. Coco is best suited for a single-pet household with gentle, patient children who understand a pet's personal space. She's small, perfect for apartment life, and is fully toilet and leash trained."
Rex,Male,2016,Mixed,L,2,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Rex was rescued from the streets by Dog Walkers Thao Dien, suffering from E-canis, extreme malnutrition, and very severe demodex causing significant fur loss. He has since recovered, gained weight, his skin completely healed with a beautiful coat. He has also developed trust in people, relishing walks and cuddles from the Laws for Paws Vietnam's volunteers. Rex is best suited for an experienced dog owner who is patient and committed to continuing his training, and to older kids who respect his personal space. He has a strong presence among dogs and may be best for a single-pet household, or an owner accustomed to managing the pack. He finds joy in leisurely walks and is fully leash trained, making him an ideal companion for those who enjoy outdoor strolls."
Li,Female,2017,Local,M,1,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Li arrived from a local shelter where she suffered from a severe skin condition, blood parasites, mange, painful cysts on her ovaries, and limited human interaction from being kept in a cage most days. With patience, surgery, and the right medication in the care of Laws for Paws Vietnam, Li is now healthy, happy, and pain-free. She's quiet and has mastered the art of apartment living from staying with a few fosters. She's leash trained and prefers light, gentle walks. While she does shed, grooming a few times a year keeps her looking her best with a beautiful soft coat. Li gets along well with dogs, especially favoring the company of male dogs. She's best suited for a family with children above 12 years old, offering her a calm and loving presence."
Nick,Male,2019,Mixed,S,2,3,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Nick was found wandering the streets of Binh Thanh just after COVID lockdown. Thanks to the efforts of the dog lovers' community, he was brought to safety and received intensive medical care for a severe skin infection, ear mites, and a subsequent ear infection. Now fully recovered and living at the Laws for Paws Vietnam shelter, he walks with confidence and a touch of swagger that earns him the nickname 'Nick the Gangster.' He's small, weighing under 10kg, leash trained, and once settled in to his new home, will need help working on toilet training. As a street-smart dog who communicates through body language and can be a bit snappy when he needs space, he's suitable for families with children aged above 12 years old. He has made great progress in improving his manners at the shelter, and would thrive with an experienced dog owner who appreciates his quirky charms and can provide further training."
Clover,Female,2023,Local,S,3,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Clover was born on 31st December 2022 at the Laws for Paws Vietnam shelter after her pregnant mom Mi was rescued. Mi's owner had passed away, and despite loving neighbors taking her in from the streets, they couldn't provide the care needed for her pregnancy and puppies. Mi gave birth to four puppies, three of which have been adopted, leaving just Clover. Clover is small with a long body and adorable short legs, making her ideal for apartment life. She's playful, sweet, and although requiring a bit of time to form new bonds, once trust is established she transforms into your best friend and loyal sidekick. As a young pup, she benefits from continued training and shouldn't be left alone for long periods of time."
Sandy,Female,2020,Mixed,M,2,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Sandy was rescued from a motorbike mechanic shop in Thao Dien, battling severe demodex and a broken leg. She has since recovered well, with her fur slowly growing back and regaining her trust in humans. Despite having a permanent limp on her back leg, she is pain-free and loves walks. She is a bit nervous at first but becomes your shadow once trust is established. She's best suited for a household with gentle children, ideally above 12 years old, who can patiently build a bond with her. Sandy serves as a reminder that through love and patience, even the toughest challenges can be overcome. Adopting a dog like Sandy not only provides a fulfilling experience but also offers a second chance to an animal who truly deserves it."
Kiki,Female,2014,Mixed,M,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Kiki was rescued by two compassionate dog lovers who found her wandering the streets with a terrible wound on her neck. While we may never fully understand why such things happen, Laws for Paws Vietnam have the privilege of being part of the healing journey that ends with smiles as big as Kiki's! After regular cleaning and a few stitches, she has since made a full recovery and is now healthy and happy. Being an older girl with challenges to her back legs, she finds joy in short, slow walks twice a day and indulges in long daytime naps. She relishes human attention and is always ready to snuggle on the sofa with you. She sometimes becomes frustrated with other dogs, especially puppies who disturb her nap time. She would do great in a home with cats or no other dogs."
Pinkie,Female,2016,Local,L,2,2,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Pinkie's mother was abandoned at a construction site where the workers had departed, leaving her locked inside. The team at Laws for Paws Vietnam had to climb over fences to reach her, only to discover that she was pregnant. As the last of her litter yet to be adopted, Pinkie has lived at the shelter since she was puppy and faced challenges in finding a home, possibly due to her more reserved nature. Despite being overlooked, Pinkie is an incredibly gentle, easy-going, friendly dog who loves cuddles. She's mastered leash training and is well behaved during her two daily walks. She would make a perfect companion for nearly any household, as she's affectionate yet an independent sleeper, and she gets along with both small children and other dogs."
Bobo,Female,2015,Mixed,S,1,3,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Bobo found her way to us from another rescue organization facing challenges with too many dogs to care for. She is deaf and easily startled, making her more cautious around new people. She thrives in a calm environment and is best suited for a quiet home with an older couple, or a single person who can offer the time and patience needed to build a strong bond. She is very loving and affectionate once comfortable, and enjoys leisurely walks around the block followed by cozy, undisturbed naps. She's leash trained, toilet trained, and her small size all make her a perfect fit for apartment living."
Shenzi,Female,2020,Local,M,1,2,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Shenzi was discovered wandering the streets of Hoc Mon in extreme heat, with severe skin infection, barely any hair on her body, and a deformed front paw. Luckily she was free of blood parasites and serious viruses, and what initially seemed like the aftermath of a dog trap on her front leg turned out to be a birth defect, giving her a little paw at the end of it. Despite this disability, she is smart, friendly, and adaptable, building up considerable muscle on the opposite leg. She has embraced life with three legs, enjoys playing with her dog friends, and relishes her two short walks a day. While a bit nervous initially and needing time to warm up to people, she becomes a loyal and loving companion once she has learned to trust you. She would thrive in a household with other furry companions for play."
Mua,Female,2021,Mixed,S,2,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Mua was found abandoned on the streets on a rainy night, inspiring her name Mua (meaning “rain” in Vietnamese). She had luxating patella on her back knees, which has now been fixed, allowing her to play and run normally. She is very cuddly, loves being around and sleeping next to you, yet showing no sign of separation anxiety so far. She adores people and has a special affinity for children, loves spending time at the park, and since she gets along equally well with other dogs of all energy levels, she's a great fit for any big, lively home. Her small size also makes her perfect for apartment life. She's a diligent student in leash training, and her ideal home would involve family member(s) who can contribute to her daily training efforts."
Mi,Female,2021,Mixed,M,2,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"When Mi's owner passed away, his children took over the house but no longer wanted to care for her. She soon found herself homeless, pregnant and relying on nearby neighbors, but they couldn’t give her the care she and her puppies would need. Under the care of Laws for Paws Vietnam, Mi gave birth to four beautiful puppies, all of whom found loving homes except for Clover. Over a year later, Mi continues to wait patiently for her forever family. Mi is the epitome of love and loyalty packed in a long body with short legs, she's independent yet affectionate. She forms deep bonds with those she trusts, ready to be your steadfast companion and snuggle by your side all day long. She thrives in a calm and loving environment, best suited to a household without other pets. While she adores human company, she may become easily excited, so a family with children over 12 years old is preferable. She is working on leash training and is fully toilet trained."
Cat Lai,Female,2020,Mixed,L,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Found wandering the streets on a scorching day with painfully infected skin and a genital tumor, Cat Lai's transformation is nothing short of remarkable. With the unwavering support of vet partners and the incredible generosity of Laws for Paws Vietnam's supporters, she found the safety she never knew. Her skin is recovering well and she's now cancer free. Reserved at first, she needs patience to build trust, but is very quiet and not aggressive. She's making steady progress with leash training and needs continued reinforcement due to her larger size. Cat Lai is good with kids above 12 years old, and although dog-friendly, she's best for households without other pets."
Muc,Female,2020,Mixed,M,2,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Muc, which means ""ink"" in Vietnamese, was rescued from the streets while pregnant and enduring scorching weather. Her story is one of survival and hope. In the care of Laws for Paws Vietnam, she gave birth to five healthy puppies in January 2024. Because of her tough past, she's initially reserved but warms up quickly, and once comfortable, becomes more affectionate each day. She's making good progress with leash and toilet training. She's family-friendly, great with children above 12 years old, and gets along well with other dogs. With her motherly duties done, Muc is ready for a new start in a loving forever home."
Bonnie,Female,2023,Mixed,M,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Bonnie's parents were abandoned at a business after the owners left for their hometown. By the time they were found, her mother was already pregnant and suffering from parvovirus, passing away soon after giving birth to Bonnie and her siblings. Mr Thao, who was looking after an abandoned school across the road, took in the puppies and made sure they were vaccinated and sterilized. He probably would have been happy to keep them, however he soon received notice that the school would be demolished to make space for residential towers. He was given until the end of May to move, and unfortunately his new location will not allow him to have more than two dogs, so Laws for Paws Vietnam stepped in to take over the care of Bonnie and her sister Betty. Bonnie is very friendly and smart, needing just an hour to warm up to new people. She's leash-trained and needs further toilet training as she's always lived outside. An independent, long-legged girl, she's very loving and makes a great addition to any home with other dogs and young children above 5 years old."
Betty,Female,2023,Mixed,M,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Betty's parents were abandoned at a business after the owners left for their hometown.

He was given until the end of May to move, and unfortunately his new location will not allow him to have more than two dogs, so Laws for Paws Vietnam stepped in to take over the care of Betty and her sister Bonnie. She's medium in size with longer legs, smart, friendly, loyal and very affectionate. She's leash-trained, making progress with toilet training, and will be with a foster family for a period of time to get accustomed to living indoors. Betty is a great addition to any home with other dogs and children above 5 years old."
Tink,Female,2019,Poodle,S,2,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Tink was rescued from a construction site in Thao Dien, where she had likely been living for some time. The workers said they were feeding her, but she was in a terrible state, with her fur matted and causing her pain. Although without any serious health issues, she has what we call fear-based aggression. She loves to to get up on the bed or couch and cuddle next to people, but should not be picked up or restrained, as this can trigger her fear. Despite this, Tink has lived safely in our care for a few years and has shown she can form deep bonds with both humans and dogs. She requires grooming a few times a year, which should be done by a vet due to her temperament. An experienced dog owner is important, or someone without children who understands her needs. She is best suited to living with dogs that are not aggressive or overly excited, who also know to respect her boundaries."
