Although without any serious health issues, she has what we call fear-based aggression. She loves to cuddle next to people, but should not be picked up or restrained, as this can trigger her fear. Despite this, Tink has lived safely in our care for a few years and has shown she can form deep bonds with both humans and calmer dogs. She requires grooming a few times a year, which should be done by a vet due to her temperament. An experienced dog owner is important, or someone without children who understands her needs."
